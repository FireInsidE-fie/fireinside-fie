hi hey hello :>

[I really like minori from project sekai! she's one of my role models really](https://media1.tenor.com/m/dJCuX1YN-eMAAAAC/hanasato-minori-project-sekai.gif)

I'm just a silly software development student living in Switzerland, currently attending the 42 school in Lausanne.
I have some C and web front-end experience- but that's about it! actively working to better myself and always learning new things :3
